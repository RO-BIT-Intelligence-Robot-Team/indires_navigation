This metapackage contains:

* *rrt_planners*:  
C++ Library and ROS wrapper for path planning in 3D. It contains the following planners:

    - *Simple RRTStar* [1] : RRT* planner in x,y,z coordinates without reasoning about kinodynamic constraints.
    - *RRT* [2] : kinodynamic RRT planner in x,y,z,yaw coordinates.
    - *Quick RRTStar*  [3] : Quick-RRT* planner in x,y,z coordinates without reasoning about kinodynamic constraints.

* *navigation_features_3d*:  
Package for calculation of sample validity and feature functions employed by the cost functions of the RRT planners for robot path planning and exploration.

* *pcl_filters*:  
ROS package to apply different filters to pointclouds. It makes use of PCL 1.9.

* *global_rrt_planner*:   
ROS plugin that allows to employ the RRT planners as global planner in the move_base architecture for navigation under ROS.

* *local_3d_planner*:   
A local controller in 3D to follow a given global path. It follows the ROS BaseLocalPlanner plugin that allows to employ the controller as local planner in the move_base architecture for navigation under ROS.

* *adapted_move_base*:   
This is a modified version of the original move_base package of ROS. This modification allows to use other global or local planners  (following the ROS move_base premises) that do not use the standard ROS Costamps for planning. Two new boolean parameters are added to indicate the use of the global and/or local costmap (use_global_costmap2d and use_local_costmap2d).

* *costmap_2d*:   
The regular costmap_2d package of ROS has a dependency on PCL. Therefore, as we are using here the version 1.9.1 of the PCL library, we need to include this package with the aim of keeping everything working properly. Only the CMakeLists.txt has been modified to take the PCL version 1.9.1 in comparison with the original ROS package (Kinetic distro). 

* *indires_macro_actions*:
A set of navigation macro-actions have been implemented by using the *actionlib* library of ROS. This way, the navigation system is employed to perform different actions as reaching an indicated goal, perform an autonomous exploration, or teleoperate the robot.

* *control_state_machine*:
Python scripts that contains the finite state machine for the interaction between the actionlib macro-actions defined in indires_macro_actions. 


The following image shows an example of the ros node graph of a simulation of the exploration and navigation system also using Gazebo as robot and environment simulator (nodes from indires_macro_actions and control_state_machine are not shown), and ethzasl_icp_mapper as SLAM algorithm [4] .
